# This program is tailored to small construction businesses and allows them to input data on each home under construction. Using this data, the cash flow of the business is projected into the future. The business is presented with a comprehensive projection of its financial state on either a weekly or monthly basis (both timelines are avaiable), including revenue, expenses per home, total revenue, homes under construction, etc. Additionally, the model is able to account for construction delays, the difference between land expenditures vs. construction expenditures, etc. All this info is presented to the user in a graphical and readily-digestable manner. If the user chooses, they can view the projection on a per home basis instead of a temporal basis.

# Built in QT Creator using C++; some of the Stanford C++ libraries are utilized.
